				<h2>Discussion: Accessibility</h2>
					<ol>
						<li><p><strong>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance)</strong></p>
						<p>I could put a font size selector on the page so that the user can choose to make the font size bigger so that the page is easier to read. This would make my app much more accessible for those who have a hard time reading small fonts.</p></li>
						
						<li><p><strong>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" - what are some of the common frustrations that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them?</strong></p>
						<p>In the examples shown, the screen readers have a very annoying robot voice. With the technology now days we could make a better screen reader. A good idea would be to have a device like Siri for computers. Also, screen readers read too much information. For example, every time there is a link on a page it will say “Link (whatever the link is) End Link”. That would be difficult to have to listen to with a page that would have a lot of links on it. I think that the user should be able to have the screen reader just read the text on the page. Then, the user could ask the screen reader to list the images or links.</p></li>
						
						<li><p><strong>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong></p>
						<p>One device would be an e-book reader, such as the iPad. An e-book reader can allow you to adjust the size of your text for easier reading for those who have trouble reading small fonts.</p>
						<p>Another would be a TTS device that turns text into speech so that a blind person can have text read to them.</p></li>
						
						<li><p><strong>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</strong></p>
						<p>A great app for accessibility is Siri for the iPhone 4S. Siri can read your text messages to you and you can speak them. It can do a lot of voice/TTY features.</p>
						<p>Another app is Purple VRS. Purple VRS is a video-based telephone relay system for deaf or hard of hearing.</p></li>
